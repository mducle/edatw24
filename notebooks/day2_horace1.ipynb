    "Yesterday, we mentioned that there are two types of objects used in Horace - `sqw` and `dnd`. When you run `cut_sqw` you rebin the data into bins you define (with the four numerical variables), but these bins are actually composed of 10's to 100's of individual detector-ToF bin elements in the original raw data, which Horace calls \"pixels\". An `sqw` object retains this \"pixel\" information whereas a `dnd` object does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default the output of `cut_sqw` is an `sqw`. If you specify the `-nopix` flag to `cut_sqw` it will create a `dnd` (where `n` is the actual dimension, so the object type will actually be `d1d`, `d2d`, etc). Now if you just want to plot the cut, you don't need the pixel information, so you can add `-nopix` to the `cut_sqw` call to save memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you retain the pixel information, then you can make new cuts _from_ the previous cut (in memory) much faster, because you don't have to load the data again from disk. We will see this in the following. Notice that we add a `tic` and `toc` before and after the `my_cut` call. This will give us the time it takes to make the cut from disk."

    "We're now going to look at how to correct for slight misalignments of the crystal in an experiment, using the bcc-Iron dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make a series of reciprocal space maps integrating over the elastic line (in the case of bcc-Iron, with `Ei=400`, a value of `[-5,5]` integrating between -10 and +10 meV is good), along different H, K and L directions/planes to identify the Bragg peaks in the data.\n",
    "2. Use the function `bragg_positions` to make and then fit transverse and radial cuts of these peaks (the function will make the cuts and do the fit for you but you need to give it the integration ranges along and perpendicular to the Q direction - you can check the [help on it here](https://pace-neutrons.github.io/Horace/unstable/manual/Correcting_for_sample_misalignment.html#bragg-positions). As a good rule of thumb, you want the cut lengths to be a bit less than a single reciprocal lattice vector, the cut width (bin size) to be as small as will give good stats, and the cut thickness to be around a third to a half of a reciprocal lattice vector. Although you can use the `'bin_relative'` keyword to give these values in reciprocal lattice units (which is fine for iron because it is cubic), in general you want to use `'bin_absolute'` so all the cuts are the same thickness, bin size etc.\n",
    "3. Use the function `bragg_position_view` to look at the cuts and fit and check they are ok - if necessary, go back to the previous step and change the parameters to `bragg_positions`. (E.g. if you see multiple peaks or no peak in your cut or the data is too noisy).\n",
    "4. Use the function `refine_crystal` to obtain the alignment correction object. Help on [this function is here](https://pace-neutrons.github.io/Horace/unstable/manual/Correcting_for_sample_misalignment.html#step-3-calculate-the-misalignment-correction). If you want to ensure that Horace keeps a cubic structure you need to give the `'fix_angdeg'` (keeps the lattice angles at 90 degrees) and `'fix_alatt_ratio'` (to keep *a=b=c*) keywords.\n",
    "5. The output of `refine_crystal` can be fed into `change_crystal` which will apply the correction to the `sqw` file itself (note that you cannot change files in the \"course_materials\" folder so should copy the file to your home folder.\n",
    "6. Make the same cuts as step 1 and check the Bragg peaks are at their nominal positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of steps 5 and 6, you could use the function `crystal_pars_correct` to compute a set of goniometer angles corresponding to the alignment correction object generated by `refine_crystal` and use this in the `gen_sqw` step instead. [Help on this is here](https://pace-neutrons.github.io/Horace/unstable/manual/Correcting_for_sample_misalignment.html#option-2-calculate-goniometer-offsets-for-regeneration-of-sqw-file-s)"
