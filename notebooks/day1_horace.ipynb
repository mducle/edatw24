    "\n",
    "The above `gen_sqw` command generates an sqw file from the list of input `spe` or `nxspe` files in one go, and deletes all temporary files after it finishes. If you are in the middle of a rotation scan, you can use `accumulate_sqw` which does not delete the temporary files and so can append newly processed `spe`/`nxspe` files to an existing sqw file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may save some time in processing, but is not now generally recommended since the implementation of parallelisation in `gen_sqw` has made `gen_sqw` much faster. This is because `accumulate_sqw` needs to know _all_ the *psi* values (including those not yet measured) in order to construct the coarse data grid that enables Horace to make fast cuts. If you then include measurements at *psi* values not in the original list, then it is possible that some data will lie outside this grid and it will be 'lost' to the sqw file. If the additional runs are ones that interleave between the original files, this will not be a problem, but if the additional runs extend the original angular range, then you must use the 'clean' option which is equivalent to running `gen_sqw`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, if any of the temporary `tmp` corresponding to each `spe`/`nxspe` file are corrupted then `accumulate_sqw` will fail and you must then either delete the corrupted `tmp` file or use the 'clean' option.\n",
