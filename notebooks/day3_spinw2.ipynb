    "   Including the effects of the anharmonicity is not possible in SpinW, except through the use of a large supercell (as in the Matsuda paper). The computational cost, for BiFeO3 is prohibitive due to the long wavelength of the cycloid (the calculations in the Matsuda paper used an optimised code on a cluster).\n",
    "\n",
    "   Calculations with SpinW are thus restricted to the `K=0` limit. Using figure 5 of the PRL paper, looking at the point where `K=0` (e.g. for zero single-ion anisotropy and hence having a harmonic cycloid) the paper suggests that a value of `D=0.185` should be used. "

    "You should see some imaginary modes – `optmagk` produces a cycloid but left the initial magnetic structure as moments parallel to the c axis.

This is because your calculations may not include all the necessary interactions to reproduce the full experimental observations. "
